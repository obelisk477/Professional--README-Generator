# Professional README Generator / Module 09

## Description

This is a simple command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquirer package. Because a README is a "must" for every project, this is a repetitive task that can be automated; so that's what this is for! The application will take in your input to a series of questions about the project and generate a README file in the same folder
## Usage

To use the application, download the code from the repo found at https://github.com/obelisk477/Professional--README-Generator. Navigate to the same directory as the "index.js" file and, assuming you have Node installed, run the command "npm i". This will install the necessary packages and dependencies.

After that, to run the application, simply type node "index.js". You will be guided through a series of promps that will be used to fill out the information for the README file you are generating. Many of the major licenses (and links to those licenses) are supported by default. After filling out all of the information, a file named "generatedREADME.md" will be created in the same folder you are currently in. This file can then be put in your upcoming project.
